# CS329H
CS329H Project - Graded BPR
Running this project and reproducing the results in the report requires just running the cells in cs329h Project.ipynb sequentially as all the required dependencies are imported within that notebook.
The repository contains the main python notebook titled cs329h Project.ipynb, this readme file and a pdf of the final report for the project.
The runtime for running the whole notebook using a T4 GPU was ~ 2 minutes.
The link to the dataset used in the notebook is the following: https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-100k.zip
